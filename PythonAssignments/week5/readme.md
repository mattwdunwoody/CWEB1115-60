**Date Magic**

The following assignment was created by ChatGPT when I asked it to do this "Create a fun and interesting assignment in Python specific to dates." I did not edit any of the language below. I then asked for a solution, which it provided, and I tested it. It is correct.

Your assignment will be to take the Python file below and add in the 26 missing parts of the code where I blocked them out with xxxxx.ï¿½ Be sure to run your code and get it executable again.

[date\_magic\_challenge.py](link removed "date_magic_challenge.py") [Download date\_magic\_challenge.py](link removed haha)

The only part of the code that we haven't covered to some level would be this:

if \_\_name\_\_ \== "\_\_main\_\_":

In an application, this is how an app knows where to start. We will talk about this later in the course when we talk about object-oriented code.

10 points for bonus challenge proposed by ChatGPT.

**Assignment Title: "Date Magic"**

**Objective:** Create a Python program that can perform various date-related operations and provide interesting insights about dates.

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a function that takes a date (in the format YYYY-MM-DD) as input and determines the day of the week it falls on.
    
2.  Create a function that calculates the age of a person based on their birthdate.
    
3.  Write a function that generates a list of all the leap years within a given range (e.g., from 2000 to 2022).
    
4.  Develop a function that takes a date and calculates the number of days remaining until an upcoming holiday of your choice (e.g., Christmas or New Year's Day).
    
5.  Bonus: Create a feature that, given a date, tells the user what historical events happened on that date (you can use APIs or a pre-defined dataset for this).
    

**Instructions:**

1.  Implement each of the functions mentioned above.
    
2.  Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their choice of operation (e.g., "1" for finding the day of the week, "2" for calculating age, etc.).
    
3.  Test your program thoroughly with various inputs and scenarios.
    
4.  Provide clear instructions for using the program and any additional information the user might need.
    
5.  Encourage creativity and presentation in the code. You can include comments and explanations to make it more engaging.
    
6.  Document your code properly, including function descriptions and how to run the program.
    

**Grading:** Students will be evaluated based on the correctness of their code, the completeness of the assignment, creativity in handling dates, and the overall presentation of the code.

This assignment not only teaches students about date manipulation in Python but also encourages them to create a user-friendly interface for date-related tasks. It also offers a bonus challenge for students who want to explore historical data integration.
